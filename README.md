# Docker Swarm Deploy Action

A [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) that enables you to publish your app as a [Docker stack](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/stack-deploy/) to a remote Docker swarm.

## Usage

Below is a brief example on how the action can be used:

```
action "Deploy to swarm" {
  uses = "sagebind/docker-swarm-deploy-action@master"
  needs = ["Push image"]
  env = {
    DOCKER_REMOTE_HOST = "ssh://user@myswarm.com"
  }
  secrets = ["DOCKER_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY", "DOCKER_SSH_PUBLIC_KEY"]
  args = "stack deploy --compose-file stack.yaml coolapp"
}
```

The `args` are passed in as args to the `docker` command after connecting to the remote swarm. To specify how to connect to your swarm, you must set the `DOCKER_REMOTE_HOST` environment variable, which takes the same syntax as the [`--host` command line flag](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/).

Below are all of the supported environment variables. Some variables used to authenticate with your swarm should be kept private, and should be configured as secrets for security.

| Variable | Description |
| - | - |
| `DOCKER_REMOTE_HOST` | Docker daemon socket to connect to. |
| `DOCKER_SSH_PUBLIC_KEY` | When connecting to Docker over SSH, this must contain the SSH public key of the server for verification. |
| `DOCKER_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` | PEM FORMAT! When connecting to Docker over SSH, this must contain the SSH private key to use to connect. |

If you are deploying any private Docker images, you can use the [Docker Login](https://github.com/actions/docker/blob/master/login) action to first log in to your private registry, and then provide the `--with-registry-auth` flag to `docker stack deploy` to use the logged in credentials during deployment.

## Convert OPENSSH to PEM format
```
ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f ~/.ssh/docker
```
